Hey there, awesome users!

We’re back with a fresh update and a handful of goodies we think you’ll love. In this release, we focused on making your experience smoother, more helpful, and—dare we say—more fun. Let’s dive into what’s new!

📘 Manuals & Guides at Your Fingertips
You asked, we listened!
Now, all manuals and guides are easily accessible from the Tools screen. Even better? We added a shiny new download button so you can take them with you wherever you go—no internet required. Whether you’re troubleshooting or just doing a little light reading (hey, no judgment), your trusty guides are now only a click away.

🐛 Bug Fixes with Style
No release is complete without a bit of bug-busting action.
We tracked down some pesky issues that were hiding out in the code jungle and kindly showed them the door. Your experience should now feel smoother, faster, and just a tad more magical. ✨

❤️ Thanks for Being Awesome
